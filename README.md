Attack-GAN Host IDS

The Attack-GAN Host IDS (Intrusion Detection System) project is designed to enhance cybersecurity by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect network intrusions based on system logs. This project aims to train a GAN model to identify anomalous patterns that could indicate malicious activity or security breaches within a host environment.

Key Features:

	•	GAN-based Anomaly Detection: Utilizes a GAN architecture to generate and classify system log data, helping to detect unusual patterns or potential intrusions.
	•	System Log Analysis: The project processes real-world system logs to train the model, ensuring it adapts to various types of network attacks.
	•	Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale log data while providing real-time analysis capabilities.
	•	Machine Learning Integration: Combines traditional host-based intrusion detection mechanisms with deep learning techniques to enhance accuracy and performance.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning model implementation.
	•	System Logs as the primary data source for anomaly detection.
	•	Scikit-learn for machine learning preprocessing.

Purpose:

The goal of the Attack-GAN Host IDS project is to demonstrate how advanced machine learning models, like GANs, can be applied to cybersecurity to improve the detection of intrusions and attacks. By training on host-based system logs, the model learns to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior, offering a robust solution for automated network security.
